# Railway Deployment - Configuration Summary

## ‚úÖ Railway Best Practices Applied

### **Single Configuration Source**
- `railway.toml` - Primary Railway configuration
- Removed conflicting `.railway/config.json`
- No Dockerfile CMD (Railway controls startup)

### **PORT Handling (Critical Fix)**
- ‚ùå OLD: `--port $PORT` (CLI argument that could be empty)
- ‚úÖ NEW: `process.env.PORT` (Railway-provided environment variable)
- Fallback: Port 3000 for local development

### **Health Check Configuration**
```toml
[deploy]
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
```

### **Environment Variables**
Railway automatically provides:
- `PORT` - Dynamic port assignment
- Service variables we set:
  - `NODE_ENV=production`
  - `TRANSPORT=http` 
  - `HOST=0.0.0.0`

## üöÄ Expected Deployment Flow

1. **Build**: Railway uses our Dockerfile
2. **Start**: `node build/index.js --transport http --host 0.0.0.0`
3. **Service reads**: `process.env.PORT` from Railway 
4. **Health check**: GET `/health` on Railway's assigned port
5. **Success**: Service shows as healthy ‚úÖ

## üîß OAuth Setup (For Calendar Functionality)

Service starts without OAuth credentials and shows:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  OAuth credentials not found. Service will start but authentication will be required later.
Visit the service URL to set up authentication when ready.
```

To enable calendar operations:
1. Create Google OAuth credentials
2. Set `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS` environment variable in Railway
3. Restart service - it will pick up credentials automatically

## üìç Current Status

- ‚úÖ Service starts successfully  
- ‚úÖ Graceful OAuth handling
- ‚úÖ Railway-compliant configuration
- ‚è≥ PORT issue should be resolved with latest fixes
- üéØ Health checks should now pass
